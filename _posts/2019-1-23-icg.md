## Background

Does the number of people imprisoned, number of penal institutions, and amount of corruption have anything to do with the type of government a country has?

When we look at the world we live in today, I always wondered if corruption and/or the type of government itself was the root of the problem with the number of penal institutions being built and the amount of people being incarcerated. I was inspired by the number of stories I would always hear of people going to a different country and going to prison. Most of the time it was some people going to North Korea or usually a different country with strict laws that these individuals would get in trouble and go to prison for a crime they did not know was a crime to begin with. Then many of the media sources would rant on how terrible this country is and how the leader is a dictator or how the people in the country are suffering from the government abusing its power over them. 

The data was created from scratch. The prison data was collected from The World Prison Brief and the corruption data was collected from Transparency International. The population data and government data was collected from Wikipedia and other sources. Originally, I wanted to collect more data on the amount of money spent building penal institutions and putting a person in jail, the type of crimes and ethnic group the imprisoned individual might have committed and came from. However, that sort of data was nonexistent for many countries since their government does not provide such data. 

If I were to predict, I would assume that countries labeled as Authoritarian and/or Dictatorship are more likely to be highly corrupted and have higher amount of penal institutions and incarcerated people while countries who are opposite, are more likely to have less incarcerated people and less penal institutions.
  
## Data

The data set consisted 209 observations and 10 variables. The following variables are Country, Population, Prison Population, Foreign (%), Female (%), Incarceration Rate (Per 100,000 of national population), Pretrial Detainees (%), Number of Penal Institutions, Government, Descriptive Form of Government, and Levels of Corruption. To note, **Country** was included the name of each country and fifteen unrecognized countries listed with the addition to Bosnia & Herzegovina split into two (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska), Hong Kong & Macao added under China, and the United Kingdom divided into England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. **Government** was the type of government each destination was categorized as while **Descriptive Form of Government** was the further description of what type of government the country had. **Levels of Corruption** there was originally a division within this category with the subcategories **Rank** and **Score**. **Rank** described where the countries stand out from each other, i.e., 1 out 180 meant the country was rated as the top country with no corruption while 180 out 180 meant it was one of the bottom countries and heavily corrupted. **Score** described the score given by the Transparency International on how corrupted the country was. A score of 1 meant it was a very clean country (no corruption) and the highest score, 100, meant it was a heavily corrupted. The **score** and **Government** were mostly used along with the variables **Country**, **Prison Population**, **Incarceration Rate**, and **Number of Penal Institutions**. The data had some missing values for some of the countries and the variables used. The data set was split into three, one data set was the cleaned data set with no missing values, the other data set had the missing values and remained the same as the original, and the last, had the names changed from categorical variables to dummy variables.
 
## Analysis

Originally, Tableau and Weka were used to do the data analysis however this time R was used to do the data analysis as well as Tableau. 
There were various techniques that I have done. The most useful was the Regression method. I wanted to see if there were any other variables that would affect the question. First, all variables were chosen to see which would be significant and then a stepwise regression model was done afterwards to confirm the original results that were taken. The best model was 

       f6 = lm(Corruption.Score ~ Pretrial.Detainees + Number.Penal.Institutions + Government, data = icg)

with a p- value of 3.146e-05. This means there is a correlation between how corrupted a country is, and the number of people being held in jail before their trial, number of penal institutions, and the type of government. 

To further see if there were any correlations, a chi-square and correlation test was done. For the chi-square, the lowest was p-value was 0.344. This was a correlation between the country versus the corruption score. This p-value is still high and not low enough. Typically, for there to be an actual correlation between the variables, the p-value must be lower than 0.05. The issue with chi-square is it only relies on two variables. More than two variables cannot be done with this test.

##### In Tableau, I created a map that shows some of the countries with the number of penal institutions, government type, corruption score, and average incarceration rate.

Norway based on my knowledge as always been the country that many sources claim to have a more humanistic approach to prisoners and within penal institutions. Prisoners are given just about the same amount of privileges as they had outside and given more trust as well as respect inside penal institutions. It is under a Monarchy rule but is also considered a Socialist country. When compared to other countries shown on the map, it has the highest corruption score and the lowest number of penal institutions and incarceration rate except for Nigeria which has the lowest incarceration rate. The United States might not be the most corrupted country based on the corruption score, but it has the highest number of penal institutions and incarceration rate average. 

## Conclusion

There was no clear evidence that there is a correlation between number of people imprisoned, number of penal institutions, and amount of corruption versus the type of government. My prediction that was made earlier was proven to be slightly incorrect. When we go back and look at the data, we see that the United States has the highest number of penal institutions and incarceration rate compared to the other countries while also close to being considered a corruption free country. It does not make sense that the US is not heavily corrupted but has more penal institutions and locks up more people than any other country including those that are considered under authoritarian/dictatorship rule and have more corruption. 

Therefore, the answer to the question 

Does the amount of people imprisoned, and number of penal institutions have anything to do with the type of government and the amount of corruption each country has?

The answer to the question is no.
