### **Imprisonment vs. Country Corruption & Government Type**
Spring 2018
Data Mining 

The data set was created from scratch using multiple sources. Using Weka and Tableau, I wanted to find out if there was a correlation between government type and corruption level with the amount of incarcerated people and jails each country and some territories have. The results showed there was no correlation between the type of government and level of corruption with the amount of people imprisoned and the number of prisons each country has.  
  
A recreation of this project can be found in the **Stories** section.  

### **The Incarceration Rates in the United States**
April - May 2016 
Structured Programming 

This was a group project using K-means clustering in Python. We concluded Republican states spent less on their inmates and rehabilitation services i.e., putting them on probation. While the Democratic states gave inmates the chance to get back into the workforce and there were lower incarceration rates.
