### **Determining the Main Factors for Recidivism in Boston**
#### September - December 2018 
#### MIT Capstone 
**Tools Used:**  R, Tableau 

Recidivism was analyzed and visualized by using a combination of prison and frisk data. The goal was to find out why recividism occurs    in Boston


### **Imprisonment vs. Country Corruption & Government Type**
#### April - May 2018
#### Data Mining 
**Tools Used:**  Weka, Tableau, & Excel 

The data set was created from scratch using multiple sources. I wanted to find out if there was a correlation between government type and corruption level with the amount of incarcerated people and jails each country and some territories have. The results showed there was no correlation between the type of government and level of corruption with the amount of people imprisoned and the number of prisons each country has.  
  
A recreation of this project can be found in the **Stories** section.  


### **The Incarceration Rates in the United States**
#### April - May 2016 
#### Structured Programming 
**Tools Used:**  Python 

This was a group project using K-means clustering. We concluded Republican states spent less on their inmates and rehabilitation services i.e., putting them on probation. While the Democratic states gave inmates the chance to get back into the workforce and there were lower incarceration rates.
