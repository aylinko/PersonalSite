 I recently graduated from Rutgers University with a masterâ€™s degree in Information Technology and Analytics (MITA). By utilizing my skills in statistical data analysis, data mining and data visualization, I would like to apply it to my interests related to crime, corruption, prison studies, and international relations. 

In the meantime, I enjoy working on my side project <a href="https://www.ethnoia.com/"> ethnoia </a>. The aim is to try to make a small impact on people and help them by having all the correct information given to them, learn about their destination, and to realize the things you see or hear in the media or by others is not always true. I believe the way we can help make our society better is by helping people and better ourselves through learning and traveling or at least experience and understand different cultures.
