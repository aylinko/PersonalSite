**Imprisonment vs. Country Corruption & Government Type**

This was a project I did for my Data Mining class. I wanted to find out if there was a correlation between government type and corruption level with the amount of incarcerated people and jails each country and some territories have. The conclusion came out to be no.


**The Incarceration Rates in the United States**

This was a group project I did for a course I took named Structured Programming. This project was done using K-means clustering in Python. We concluded Republican states spent less on their inmates and rehabilitation services i.e., putting them on probation. While the Democratic states gave inmates the chance to get back into the workforce and there were lower incarceration rates.
